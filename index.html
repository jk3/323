<h2>Bloodless, Forgotten, A Flickering Hallucination</h2>
<br><<br>
<p>Her river flows. An open road. Pool succumbed to darkness. Blood drips faster as a waterfall takes away what she had. The tragedy of perfection. The eagles swarm, the wounds multiply. She loses sight of the night. He falls off the bridge caught by death this time. Her pieces are serenity.</p>

 <h4>

  <p>There is a great illusion within me.
I feel as though around me and within my mind is a network of tides. I feel a great surge of force, beyond my control my ordinary surroundings are replaced with the power of water, a great ride which pulls me where it pleases, it is as though when I look up at the moon I can see my mind, the tides a manifestation of my helplessness.

The Dillusion which I fear is real, and the picture which I see clashes with my expectations. I stare into the depths of the endless ocean, but it is dark and hopeless, I know that I am alone. The sky becomes a mouth of darkness that swallows me. Frantically, I run, a shattering vision of space glitters in pieces before my eyes, alone I charge up the stairwell, but it seems to go on forever, I ask the keeper, but I am he, I can't stop flying up this surgence, and yet I can still taste the vibrant colors of yesterday.

The magnificent wall of ice bleeds holes, the time can bend
